                <p id = "about-content"> <strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah (December 25, 1876 â€“ September 11, 1948)</strong> was a pivotal figure in the creation of Pakistan, serving as its founder and first Governor-General. Initially an advocate for Hindu-Muslim unity, Jinnah later championed the Two-Nation Theory, leading to the formation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. As leader of the All-India Muslim League and a key player in the political landscape of British India, he played a crucial role in shaping the Lahore Resolution and navigating the complex path to independence. His leadership during Pakistan's early days focused on establishing government structures, formulating policies, and aiding millions of refugees. While he remains a revered figure in Pakistan as Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"), his legacy is less prominent in India.</p>
